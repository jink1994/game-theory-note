    "##### Strategic reasoning\n",
    "    Same game: each player best responds to other players is the Nash Equilibrium\n",
    "    From 1 to 100, players choose the score for a model on magazines. The one who vote for the 2?3 of the average score wins the game.\n",
    "        THeoretically, everyone should vote for 1(smallest possible score)\n",
    "        Actually, 23 voters won in the first game.\n",
    "        Then in the second game, when every participants are aware of the rules, 4 voters won.\n",
    "    SHould we expect equilibria to be played?\n",
    "    Or non-equilibria?\n",
    "    Nash equilibrium maybe too perfect(requires a complete rationality for every players) to achieve\n",
    "##### Pure strategy nash equilibrium\n",
    "##### Dominant strategies\n",
    "    Domination\n",
    "        Strategy is choosing an ction ('pure strategy')\n",
    "        Strictly dominates: >\n",
    "        Very weakly dominates: >=\n",
    "    If evry player has a dominant strategy, the game will converge to a nash equilibrium\n",
    "    If every player has a strictly dominant strategy, the NE must be unique\n",
    "##### Pareto optimality\n",
    "    Analyzing games: can games be better as an outsiders?\n",
    "    Pareto-dominates: outcome 1 at least good a outcome 2 for every player\n",
    "    Why every game must have at least one Pareto optimal? By defination, if a cell is not a pareto optimal, there must be a cell pareto-dominates this cell, making the other cell pareto optimal.\n",
    "    Fun fact about prisoner's dilemma:\n",
    "        the nash equilibrium in this game is the only non-Pareto-optimal outcome.\n",
